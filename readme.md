# Coventry Parliamentary Expenses

This is just a small repo for me to practise using the python pandas library for simple data manipulation. To make it more interesting for me, I was looking through data downloaded from the [Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority](http://parliamentarystandards.org.uk), which details every expenses claim made by UK MPs betweek 2010 - 2016. In particular, I was looking at my MP, Geoffrey Robinson, and comparing his expenses claims with other local MPs. 

This is not meant to be a thorough investigation on MPs expenses, it's just an excuse for me to practise with Pandas and ipython notebook.
